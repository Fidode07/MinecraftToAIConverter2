# ü§ñ MinecraftToAIConverter ü§ñ
MinecraftToAIConverter<strong>2</strong> is the successor of my old project <a href="https://github.com/Fidode07/MinecrafToAIConverter">MinecraftToAIConverter</a>. Since I didn't know much about artificial intelligence 
and Python back then, it was more of a "project to learn". 
Therefore, after almost 2 years, I finally decided to revise the project. Well, actually I rather rewrote it.


# üõ†Ô∏è New features &amp; optimized things üõ†Ô∏è
The old version had many problems. A lot, in fact. I have improved that:
- <strong>Structured Code</strong>: The old version was a bunch of files and scripts thrown together. I didn't even really use classes. In the new version, everything is in a functional structure.
- <strong>Translation to TensorFlow</strong>: I don't want to start an dispute or a discussion, so let's see this neither as a contra nor as a pro. I have translated the model from PyTorch to TensorFlow.
- <strong>Word2Vec</strong>: The old function worked using the well-known Bag of Words method. What we are all thinking now: Shit. But don't worry, this has of course been revised. The new version uses a simple and easily customizable Word2Vec class.
- <strong>Multiple datasets</strong>: Yes, you heard right. The Train function automatically merges your datasets as long as they all follow the structure described below. So you can swap out all your data and don't have to keep a 1GB .json file.
- <strong>Usable response</strong>: The old Python server actually only had a random response that belonged to the tag. So the plugin behind it couldn't do anything with it except send it directly to the player. The new code responds in the JSON response, which makes it possible to have more control in the plugin itself. For example, you can add custom quests and menus.

# üìä Dataset structure üìä
The Dataset is pretty basic. The code is easily extendable, so if you are missing something, have fun extending it. Anyway, here are all the parameters that needs to be given:
- <strong>tag</strong>: A unique tag/identifier for the intent
- <strong>patterns</strong>: A list of strings that contains all your example sentences
- <strong>responses</strong>: A list of strings containing all your answer sentences

<strong>NOTE: Your intents must be in an "intents" list, which is absolute.</strong>
Example:
```json
{
  "intents": [
    {
      "tag": "greeting",
      "patterns": [
        "hello",
        "hi",
        "hey",
        "howdy",
        "good morning",
        "good afternoon",
        "greetings",
        "whats up",
        "hows it going"
      ],
      "responses": [
        "hello",
        "hi there",
        "hey",
        "howdy",
        "good day how can i assist you",
        "greetings what brings you here",
        "hello how can i help you"
      ]
    },
    {
      "tag": "bye",
      "patterns": [
        "adios",
        "bye",
        "see you",
        "see ya",
        "farewell",
        "goodbye",
        "take care",
        "until next time"
      ],
      "responses": [
        "goodbye",
        "farewell",
        "see you later",
        "take care",
        "until next time",
        "adios",
        "bye for now",
        "see ya"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
